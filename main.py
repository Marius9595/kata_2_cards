KATA CARDS

CONTEXT:
    There are two players and they play with cards with the following rank:
         1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 7 > 8 > 9 > J > Q > K

BEHAVIOUR:

    # one by one card is distribuited to each player, when the second one
    has 2 cards, is ok the dealing

    # The first card compites with other first card and the same logic for the
    second one

    # The bigger gives to player a point in each duel

    # It can be happen a Tie if the same value card is dueled

    # The score is result of sum of the two duels

    # The player with the higgest score is the winner and the other losser
